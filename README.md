RegexCacheSearchPlugin
======================

Old now was for Foswiki 1.0 the Store API has changed from 1.1 onwards

Sped up searches by caching the hits from Regex searches on the Store

It does contain one serious, yet easily fixable bug, so I cannot recommend my hard work anymore.
If you really need this on a FW 1.0 set-up then let me know.
